# Roll20 Charactersheets

These are charactersheets created for personal use.

#### Chronicles of Darkness

The Chronicles of Darkness charactersheet is a modified version of the [Official Chronicles of Darkness sheet](https://github.com/Roll20/roll20-character-sheets/tree/master/Chronicles%20of%20Darkness). It has been modified to better support Mage the Awakening games. Though a bit janky.

#### Cthulhu Tech

Created for Cthulhu Tech (2007) heavily inspired by the second iteration of the [official sheets](https://www.yumpu.com/en/document/view/11616736/cthulhutech-player-sheets). This sheet also has support for the framewerk calculations.

#### Unknown Armies

Created for Unknown Armies (3rd edition). Has support for the flipflop mechanic.
